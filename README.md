This project demonstrates a slashie job matching website. It was built by Vue.js, Java Spring Boot framework and H2 console as front-end, backend and database development.

This project involves 3 stages. We determined 27 user stories for the whole application in the first stage. Then we built 14 endpoints in our backend project in stage 2. Finally we built the full-stack web application to meet the most 7 important user stories. We simply use a specific employer and an applicant to demonstrate those user stories.

The 7 user stories are listed as below:

Employer can:
-	Create a new job post,
-	View the list of his/her own job posts,
-	View all applications of a particular job post created by him/her,
-	Employ/hire the applicant that he/she wants.

Applicant can:
-	Apply a job with providing his/her skills,
-	View the job list with open status,
-	View the post he/she applied for.

*There are two statuses, for employer and applicant, for each job. Both statuses of the specific job will be updated according to the event of different user stories.
